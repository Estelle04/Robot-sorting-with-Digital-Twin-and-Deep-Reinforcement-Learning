# Robot-sorting-with-Digital-Twin-and-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains a Unity-based simulation of a robotic sorting system that integrates a digital twin architecture with deep reinforcement learning. A digital twin-enabled interface and UDP-based communication pipeline are used for real-time feedback and interaction with the physical robot arm. In reinforcement learning, the robotic agent learns to pick and place colored goal cubes into a designated drop point using continuous torque control.
